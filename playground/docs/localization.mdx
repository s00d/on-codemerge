# Language and Localization

Welcome to the documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a versatile web editor designed for seamless integration and functionality with multi-language support.

import EditorComponent from '@site/src/components/EditorComponent';

<EditorComponent activePlugins={['TextStylingButton', 'TableButton']} language="ru" />

## Getting Started

Start by installing **On-Codemerge** in your project.

### Installation

To install `on-codemerge`, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm i --save on-codemerge
```

## Localization

On-Codemerge supports multiple languages, making it a versatile choice for international projects. To use a specific language, use the `setCurrentLanguage` method in the EditorCore i18n.

### Supported Locales

On-Codemerge currently supports the following locales:

- German (`de`)
- English (`en`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- French (`fr`)
- Japanese (`ja`)
- Korean (`ko`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- Russian (`ru`)
- Chinese (`zh`)

Each language pack can be included in your project and configured as needed.

## Integration Example

Here's a basic example of integrating On-Codemerge into a vanilla JavaScript project with localization support:

```jsx title="Initialize and Register"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const locale = 'de';
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    // ... register other modules
    editor.i18n.setCurrentLanguage(locale);
  }
});
```

Each plugin adds unique functionality to the On-Codemerge editor, making it a powerful tool for web content creation and editing in various languages.
