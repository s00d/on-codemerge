# BlockButton Plugin

The `BlockButton` plugin introduces advanced block management within the On-Codemerge editor. It provides capabilities for creating, manipulating, and organizing content blocks.

import EditorComponent from '@site/src/components/EditorComponent';

<EditorComponent activePlugins={['BlockButton']} />

## Integration

To integrate the `BlockButton` plugin, import and register it with the `EditorCore`. Follow these steps:

```jsx title="Initialize and Register BlockButton"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import { BlockButton } from 'on-codemerge/blockButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    editor.registerModule(new BlockButton());
  }
});
```

## Features

The `BlockButton` plugin provides functionalities such as:

- **Block Creation:** Adds a new block to the editor.
- **Block Management:** Manages individual blocks within the editor, allowing for customized content arrangement.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Facilitates drag-and-drop actions for easy block repositioning.

When activated, the plugin adds a button to the toolbar for creating new content blocks and dynamically manages them.

## How it Works

The `BlockButton` plugin leverages a combination of DOM manipulation and event handling for its operations. It works as follows:

- **Block Initialization:** Upon initialization, the plugin scans the editor for existing blocks and sets up management for each.
- **Dynamic Block ID Assignment:** New blocks are assigned unique IDs for identification and management.
- **Event Handling:** The plugin attaches event listeners to blocks for operations like drag-and-drop.
