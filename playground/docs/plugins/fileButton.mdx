# FileButton Plugin

The `FileButton` plugin is a comprehensive file management tool for the On-Codemerge editor. It enhances the editor's capabilities by allowing users to upload, display, and manage files directly within the editor interface.

import EditorComponent from '@site/src/components/EditorComponent';

<EditorComponent activePlugins={['FileButton']} />

## Integration

To integrate the `FileButton` plugin into the On-Codemerge editor, you need to import and register it with the `EditorCore`. Follow these steps for a seamless integration:

```jsx title="Initialize and Register FileButton"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import { FileButton } from 'on-codemerge/fileButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    const fileButton = new FileButton('YOUR_FILE_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT', 'YOUR_FILE_DELETE_ENDPOINT');
    editor.registerModule(fileButton);
  }
});
```

## Features

The `FileButton` plugin offers a range of functionalities to handle files:

- **Multiple File Upload:** Users can select and upload multiple files simultaneously.
- **File Display:** Once uploaded, each file is represented as a block within the editor, showing the file's name.
- **Download Link:** Each file block includes a download link, allowing users to download the file directly from the editor.
- **File Deletion:** Users can delete uploaded files from the server and remove their representations from the editor.

## How it Works

The `FileButton` operates by:

1. **Uploading Files:** When the user selects files, the plugin uploads them to a specified server endpoint using a `FormData` object and an asynchronous `fetch` request.

2. **Creating File Blocks:** For each uploaded file, a block is created in the editor with the file's name and a download link. The blocks are styled for clear visibility and user interaction.

3. **Handling File Deletion:** The plugin allows for the deletion of files. When a file is deleted, a request is sent to a server endpoint, and the corresponding block is removed from the editor.

The `FileButton` plugin utilizes modern JavaScript features and async/await syntax for efficient file handling, making it a robust addition to the On-Codemerge editor suite.
