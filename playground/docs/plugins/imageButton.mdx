# ImageButton Plugin

The `ImageButton` plugin adds image uploading and management capabilities to the On-Codemerge editor. This plugin enables users to insert images directly into the editor from their device.

import EditorComponent from '@site/src/components/EditorComponent';

<EditorComponent activePlugins={['ImageButton']} />

## Integration

To integrate the `ImageButton` plugin with the On-Codemerge editor, import and register it with the `EditorCore` as follows:

```jsx title="Initialize and Register ImageButton"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import { ImageButton } from 'on-codemerge/imageButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    editor.registerModule(new ImageButton());
  }
});
```

## Features

The `ImageButton` plugin provides the following features:

- **Image Upload:** Adds a toolbar button for uploading images.
- **Image Management:** Manages inserted images, allowing for further customization and control.

## How it Works

When the image button in the toolbar is clicked, it triggers an image file input. Users can select an image from their device, which is then read and inserted into the editor.
