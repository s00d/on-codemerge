# CodeEditorButton Plugin

The `CodeEditorButton` plugin integrates a CodeMirror-based HTML editor into the On-Codemerge editor, providing an enhanced interface for editing HTML content directly.

import EditorComponent from '@site/src/components/EditorComponent';

<EditorComponent activePlugins={['CodeEditorButton']} />

## Integration

To use the `CodeEditorButton` plugin, you need to import and register it with the `EditorCore`. The integration process is as follows:

```jsx title="Initialize and Register CodeEditorButton"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import { CodeEditorButton } from 'on-codemerge/codeEditorButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    editor.registerModule(new CodeEditorButton());
  }
});
```

## Features

The `CodeEditorButton` plugin offers the following features:

- **HTML Editor Integration:** Incorporates a CodeMirror editor for direct HTML editing within the On-Codemerge editor.
- **Modal Window:** Presents the HTML editor in a modal window for focused editing.
- **Customizable Styles:** Includes CSS styles that can be customized as per the application's design requirements.

When activated, the plugin adds an 'HTML' button to the toolbar. Clicking this button opens the modal with the HTML editor.

The plugin operates by creating a modal window and initializing a CodeMirror editor instance within it:
