<EditorComponent activePlugins={['TableButton']} />

## Integration

To integrate the `TableButton` plugin with the On-Codemerge editor, follow these steps:

1. Import the `TableButton` class from the plugin package.
2. Initialize an instance of `EditorCore`.

import { TableButton } from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const appElement = document.getElementById('app');
  if (appElement) {
    const editor = new EditorCore(appElement);
    editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
  }
});
```

## How it Works

The `TableButton` plugin enhances the editor's toolbar by adding a "Table" button that allows users to create tables. When the button is clicked, users can specify the number of rows and columns for the table they want to create. The table is inserted into the editor's content, and users can interact with it.

### Table Creation

- Users click the "Table" button in the editor's toolbar.
- A dialog prompts users to specify the number of rows and columns for the table.
- The table is created with the specified dimensions and inserted into the editor.

### Table Management

- Tables are fully editable, allowing users to input text and make changes.
- Users can resize tables by dragging the edges of rows and columns.
- Tables support headers for both rows and columns.
- The plugin retains table data and settings even if the editor's content is modified or reloaded.

### Customization

The appearance and styling of tables can be customized using CSS styles. You can apply custom styles to tables to match your application's design.

## Example Usage
