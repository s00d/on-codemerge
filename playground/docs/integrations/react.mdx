# React

Welcome to the React-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a flexible web editor designed for smooth integration into React applications.

## Getting Started with React

To incorporate On-Codemerge into your React project, begin by installing it.

### Installation

Execute the following command in your React project directory to install `on-codemerge`:

```bash
npm i --save on-codemerge
```

## React Integration Example

Here is a straightforward example demonstrating how to integrate On-Codemerge into a React project:

```jsx title="MyEditorComponent.jsx"
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

const MyEditorComponent = () => {
  const editorRef = useRef(null);
  let editor;

  useEffect(() => {
    if (editorRef.current) {
      editor = new EditorCore(editorRef.current);
      editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... register other modules

      editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
        console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
      });

      // Optional: Set initial content
      editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
    }
  }, []);

  return <div ref={editorRef}></div>;
};

export default MyEditorComponent;
```

In this React component, we use the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the DOM element that will host the editor. The `useEffect` hook is then utilized to instantiate the editor with `EditorCore` and attach it to the referenced element. Modules such as `TextStylingButton` and `TableButton` are registered to add functionality to the On-Codemerge editor. The `subscribeToContentChange` method is used to handle content changes, allowing for responsive and dynamic content editing within your React application.
