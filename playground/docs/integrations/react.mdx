# React

Welcome to the React-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a flexible web editor designed for smooth integration into React applications.

## Getting Started with React

To incorporate On-Codemerge into your React project, begin by installing it.

### Installation

Execute the following command in your React project directory to install `on-codemerge`:

```bash
npm i --save on-codemerge
```

## React Integration Example

Here is a straightforward example demonstrating how to integrate On-Codemerge into a React project:

```jsx title="MyEditorComponent.jsx"
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

const MyEditorComponent = ({ value, onValueChange }) => {
  const editorRef = useRef(null);
  const [editor, setEditor] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (editorRef.current && !editor) {
      const newEditor = new EditorCore(editorRef.current);
      newEditor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      newEditor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... register other modules

      newEditor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
        console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
        if (onValueChange) {
          onValueChange(newContent);
        }
      });

      setEditor(newEditor);
    }

    // Set initial content
    if (editor && value) {
      editor.setContent(value);
    }
  }, [editor, value]);

  return <div ref={editorRef}></div>;
};

export default MyEditorComponent;
```

In this React component, we use the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the DOM element that will host the editor. The `useEffect` hook is then utilized to instantiate the editor with `EditorCore` and attach it to the referenced element. Modules such as `TextStylingButton` and `TableButton` are registered to add functionality to the On-Codemerge editor. The `subscribeToContentChange` method is used to handle content changes, allowing for responsive and dynamic content editing within your React application.
