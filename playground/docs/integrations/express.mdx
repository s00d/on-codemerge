# Express

Welcome to the Express.js-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a sophisticated web editor designed for easy integration with Express.js applications, enhancing your Node.js server applications with powerful frontend editing capabilities.

## Getting Started with Express.js

To integrate On-Codemerge into your Express.js application, you'll be embedding it into the HTML pages that your Express.js server renders.

### Installation

1. **Install `on-codemerge`**: If you're using a modern frontend build system like Webpack or Browserify in your Express.js project, you can install On-Codemerge directly via npm.

```bash
npm install --save on-codemerge
   ```

2. **Without a Frontend Build System**: If you're not using a frontend build system, you might need to include On-Codemerge directly in your HTML via a CDN or by hosting the files yourself.

## Express.js Integration Example

Here's how to integrate On-Codemerge into an Express.js application:

1. **Set Up Your Express.js Server**: If you haven't already, set up your Express.js application. Here's a basic setup:

```javascript title="app.js"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
   res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
   console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
   ```

2. **Create Your HTML File**: In your `public` directory, create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`). This is where you'll include On-Codemerge.

```html title="public/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your Express App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="editor"></div>
  <script src="path/to/on-codemerge.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/your/javascript/file.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
   ```

Make sure to include the On-Codemerge JavaScript file, either as a local file in your `public` directory or via a CDN.

3. **Initialize On-Codemerge in a JavaScript File**: Create a JavaScript file in your `public` directory to initialize On-Codemerge.

```javascript title="public/path/to/your/javascript/file.js"
// If On-Codemerge is installed via npm and using a build system
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

// If On-Codemerge is included via a script tag, access it via global scope
const EditorCore = window.OnCodemerge.EditorCore;
const TextStylingButton = window.OnCodemerge.TextStylingButton;
const TableButton = window.OnCodemerge.TableButton;

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
   const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');
   if (editorElement) {
      const editor = new EditorCore(editorElement);
      editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... additional configuration

      editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
         console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
      });

      editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
   }
});
   ```

By following these steps, you can integrate On-Codemerge into an Express.js application, providing a sophisticated text editing tool in your web applications. This integration allows you to leverage Express.js's capabilities for server-side logic while incorporating advanced web technologies like On-Codemerge in the frontend.
