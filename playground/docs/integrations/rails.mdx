# Rails

Welcome to the Ruby on Rails-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a dynamic web editor designed for seamless integration with Ruby on Rails, enhancing Rails applications with advanced frontend editing capabilities.

## Getting Started with Ruby on Rails

To use On-Codemerge in your Ruby on Rails project, you'll need to set up the frontend environment where the editor will be utilized.

### Installation

1. **Using Webpacker (Rails 6 and later)**: If you are using Rails 6 or later, you likely have Webpacker installed. You can add `on-codemerge` to your JavaScript bundle.

```bash
yarn add on-codemerge
```

2. **Using the Asset Pipeline (Older Rails Versions)**: If you're using an older version of Rails or prefer the asset pipeline, you'll need to manually download `on-codemerge` and its dependencies, and include them in your app's assets.

## Ruby on Rails Integration Example

### Webpacker Integration (Rails 6+)

1. **Create a JavaScript Pack**: In `app/javascript/packs`, create a new file (e.g., `editor.js`).

```javascript title="app/javascript/packs/editor.js"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
   const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');
   if (editorElement) {
      const editor = new EditorCore(editorElement);
      editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... additional configuration

      editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
         console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
      });

      editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
   }
});
```

2. **Include the Pack in Your View**: Use the `javascript_pack_tag` helper in your Rails view to include the editor pack.

```erb title="app/views/layouts/application.html.erb"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <%= javascript_pack_tag 'editor', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  <!-- Other head elements -->
</head>
<body>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
```

### Asset Pipeline Integration

1. **Add JavaScript Files**: Place your JavaScript files, including `on-codemerge` and its dependencies, in `app/assets/javascripts`.

2. **Require Files in Application.js**: Make sure to require `on-codemerge` and its dependencies in your `application.js`.

```javascript title="app/assets/javascripts/application.js"
//= require on-codemerge
//= require textStylingButton
//= require tableButton
// Other requires
```

3. **Initialize On-Codemerge in Your View**: You can write inline JavaScript in your view file or create a separate JavaScript file to initialize On-Codemerge.

```erb title="app/views/your_view.html.erb"
<div id="editor"></div>
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Initialization code as shown above
  });
</script>
```

By following these steps, you can integrate On-Codemerge into a Ruby on Rails application, providing an enhanced text editing experience in both newer and older Rails applications. This integration allows you to leverage On-Codemerge's capabilities within the Rails asset management system, whether that's through Webpacker or the traditional asset pipeline.
