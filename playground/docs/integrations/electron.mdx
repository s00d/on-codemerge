# Electron

Welcome to the Electron-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, an advanced web editor designed for seamless integration with Electron applications, enhancing desktop apps with sophisticated text editing capabilities.

## Getting Started with Electron

To integrate On-Codemerge into your Electron application, you'll be embedding it into the HTML pages that your Electron app renders, much like integrating it into a standard web page.

### Installation

1. **Install `on-codemerge`**: If your Electron project uses npm for package management, you can install On-Codemerge directly.

```bash
npm install --save on-codemerge
   ```

## Electron Integration Example

Here's how to integrate On-Codemerge into an Electron application:

1. **Create or Modify Your Electron HTML Page**: Open or create an HTML file that will be loaded by your Electron application. This could typically be your `index.html` file.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your Electron App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="editor"></div>
  <script src="path/to/on-codemerge.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/your/javascript/file.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
   ```

Ensure you include the On-Codemerge JavaScript file, either from a local copy or via a CDN.

2. **Initialize On-Codemerge in Your JavaScript File**: Create or modify a JavaScript file that initializes On-Codemerge. This file is referenced in your HTML file.

```javascript title="path/to/your/javascript/file.js"
const EditorCore = require('on-codemerge');
const TextStylingButton = require('on-codemerge/textStylingButton');
const TableButton = require('on-codemerge/tableButton');

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
   const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');
   if (editorElement) {
      const editor = new EditorCore(editorElement);
      editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... additional configuration

      editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
         console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
      });

      editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
   }
});
   ```

3. **Load the HTML Page in Electron**: In your main Electron JavaScript file, load the HTML page as you would normally.

```javascript title="main.js"
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow () {
  // Create the browser window.
  let win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true
    }
  });

  // and load the index.html of the app.
  win.loadFile('path/to/index.html');
}

app.on('ready', createWindow);
   ```

Make sure the `webPreferences.nodeIntegration` option is set appropriately if your setup requires it.

By following these steps, you can integrate On-Codemerge into an Electron application, providing a powerful text editing tool in your desktop applications. This approach leverages Electron's ability to render web-based content, allowing you to include sophisticated web technologies like On-Codemerge in your cross-platform desktop applications.
