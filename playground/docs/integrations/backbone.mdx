# Backbone.js

Welcome to the Backbone.js-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a versatile web editor designed for integration with Backbone.js, a framework known for its lightweight and straightforward approach to building web applications.

## Getting Started with Backbone.js

To integrate On-Codemerge into your Backbone.js project, start with installing the package.

### Installation

Execute the following command in your Backbone.js project directory:

```bash
npm i --save on-codemerge
```

## Backbone.js Integration Example

Integrating On-Codemerge in a Backbone.js application can be done by creating a custom view:

1. **Create a Backbone View**: You will need to create a Backbone view for the On-Codemerge editor. This view will handle initializing and rendering the editor.

 ```javascript title="OnCodemergeView.js"
 import Backbone from 'backbone';
 import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
 import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
 import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

 const OnCodemergeView = Backbone.View.extend({
   initialize: function() {
     this.editor = new EditorCore(this.el);
     this.editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
     this.editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
     // ... register other modules

     this.editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
       console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
     });
   },

   render: function() {
     // Optional: Set initial content
     this.editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
     return this;
   },

   remove: function() {
     this.editor.destroy();
     Backbone.View.prototype.remove.call(this);
   }
 });

 export default OnCodemergeView;
```

This Backbone view initializes the editor in the `initialize` method and sets the initial content in the `render` method. The `remove` method ensures proper cleanup.

2. **Instantiate and Render the View**: In your application, create an instance of this view and render it.

 ```javascript title="app.js"
 import OnCodemergeView from './OnCodemergeView';

 const editorView = new OnCodemergeView({ el: '#editorContainer' });
 editorView.render();
```

Here, you're attaching the OnCodemerge editor to a specific DOM element (`#editorContainer`) and then calling the `render` method to initialize the editor's content.

This setup provides a Backbone.js-centric way of integrating On-Codemerge, allowing you to utilize this advanced web editor within the context of a Backbone.js application. The approach leverages Backbone's View system to encapsulate the editor's initialization and management, fitting well with Backbone's overall architectural style.
