# Django

Welcome to the Django-specific documentation for **On-Codemerge**, a versatile web editor designed for easy integration with Django applications, bringing advanced editing capabilities to Django's robust backend system.

## Getting Started with Django

To use On-Codemerge in your Django project, you will need to set up the frontend environment where the editor will be utilized.

### Installation

1. **Prepare Your JavaScript File**: You can either use a JavaScript bundler like Webpack or include a simple JavaScript file in your Django project. For simplicity, this example will use a plain JavaScript file.

2. **Download or Install `on-codemerge`**: You can either download the `on-codemerge` package and its dependencies and include them in your project's static files, or if you're using a JavaScript bundler, install it via npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install --save on-codemerge
```

or

```bash
yarn add on-codemerge
   ```

## Django Integration Example

Here's how to integrate On-Codemerge into a Django application:

1. **Create Your JavaScript File**: Create a new JavaScript file in your Django static files. This file will initialize On-Codemerge.

```javascript title="static/js/editor.js"
import EditorCore from 'on-codemerge';
import TextStylingButton from 'on-codemerge/textStylingButton';
import TableButton from 'on-codemerge/tableButton';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
   const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');
   if (editorElement) {
      const editor = new EditorCore(editorElement);
      editor.registerModule(new TextStylingButton());
      editor.registerModule(new TableButton());
      // ... additional configuration

      editor.subscribeToContentChange((newContent) => {
         console.log('Content changed:', newContent);
      });

      editor.setContent("Initial content goes here");
   }
});
```

2. **Include the JavaScript in Your Django Template**: In your Django template, include the JavaScript file.

```html title="templates/your_template.html"
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Head Contents -->
</head>
<body>
    <div id="editor"></div>
    <script src="{% static 'js/editor.js' %}"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure the path to the JavaScript file is correct, and use Django's `{% static %}` template tag to correctly reference static files.

3. **Collect Static Files**: If you haven't already, run Django's `collectstatic` command to ensure all static files are gathered in the static files directory.

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

By following these steps, you can integrate On-Codemerge into a Django application, allowing you to enhance your web projects with rich text editing features. This integration involves setting up the editor in a JavaScript file and then embedding it within Django's templating system, ensuring a seamless combination of Django's powerful backend capabilities with advanced frontend text editing.
